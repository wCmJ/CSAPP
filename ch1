buses:
    electrical condiuts
    carry bytes of information back and forth between the components
    transfer fixed-sized chunks of bytes known as words.
    
IO devices:
    the system's connection to the external world
    I/O devices     <--->   controller/adapter      <--->       I/O bus
    controller: chip sets in the device itself or motherboard
    adapter:    card that plugs into a slot on the motherboard
        the purpose of both is to transfer information between I/O devices and I/O bus
        
main memory:
    temporary storage device 
    DRAM/linear array of bytes
    
central processing unit:
    engine that interprets instructions stored in main memory
    program counter points to main memory
        read/interpret/perform/update
    some simple operations that CPU might carry out at the request of an instruction:
        Load:
            copy a byte or a word from main memory into a register, overwriting the previous contents of the register.
        Store:
            copy a byte or a word from a register to a location in main memory, overwriting the previous contents of that location
        Operate:
            copy the ocntents of two registers to the ALU, perform an arithmetic operation on the two words, and store the result in a register, overwriting the previous contents of that register
        Jump:
            extract a word from the insturction itself and copy that word into the PC, overwriting the previous value of the PC.
